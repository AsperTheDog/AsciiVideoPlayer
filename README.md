# AsciiVideoPlayer
Receives an mp4 file and transforms it into ascii art in the terminal.


## Usage
Simply drag an mp4 file to the exe file and it will run. The video will play at the maximum resolution it can get within the terminal, so make sure to maximize. 

There is a cfg file where you can put your own palette. The format for the character palette is from the darkest to the brightest, the lenght can vary and the system will add a whitespace as darkest option by itself.

## Limitations
If you zoom out in the terminal too much the resolution will get too high and the program will run the video at a slower pace, this is a limitation on the speed at which the program can update the terminal.
